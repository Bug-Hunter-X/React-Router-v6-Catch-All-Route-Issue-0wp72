This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in React Router v6 related to the catch-all route (`/*`).  The issue arises when a catch-all route is placed after more specific routes.  Even if a URL matches a more specific route, the catch-all route seems to take precedence, leading to unexpected rendering of the NotFound component. The solution shows how to properly structure routes to avoid this.
